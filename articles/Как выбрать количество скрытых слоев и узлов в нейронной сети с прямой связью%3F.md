# Как выбрать количество скрытых слоев и узлов в нейронной сети с прямой связью?

Я понимаю, что на этот вопрос дан ответ, но я не думаю, что существующий ответ действительно затрагивает вопрос, помимо указания ссылки, обычно связанной с предметом вопроса. В частности, ссылка описывает один метод для программной конфигурации сети, но это не «_стандартный и принятый метод_» для конфигурации сети.

Следуя небольшому набору четких правил, можно программно установить компетентную сетевую архитектуру (то есть количество и тип нейронных слоев и количество нейронов, составляющих каждый слой). Следуя этой схеме, вы получите грамотную архитектуру, но, вероятно, не оптимальную.

Но после инициализации этой сети вы можете итеративно настраивать конфигурацию во время обучения, используя ряд вспомогательных алгоритмов; одно семейство этих работ выполняется _pruning_ узлами, основанными на (малых) значениях вектора веса после определенного количества обучающих эпох - другими словами, устраняя ненужные / избыточные узлы (подробнее об этом ниже).

Таким образом, каждый NN имеет три типа слоев: _input_, _hidden_ и _output_.

Creating the NN architecture therefore means coming up with values for the number of layers of each type and the number of nodes in each of these layers.

 **The Input Layer** 

Simple--every NN has exactly one of them--no exceptions that I'm aware of.

With respect to the number of neurons comprising this layer, this parameter is completely and uniquely determined once you know the shape of your training data. Specifically, _the number of neurons comprising that layer is equal to the number of features (columns) in your data_ . Some NN configurations add one additional node for a bias term.

* * *

 **The Output Layer** 

Like the Input layer, every NN has _exactly one_ output layer. Determining its size (number of neurons) is simple; it is completely determined by the chosen model configuration.

Is your NN going running in _Machine_ Mode or _Regression_ Mode (the ML convention of using a term that is also used in statistics but assigning a different meaning to it is very confusing). Machine mode: returns a class label (e.g., "Premium Account"/"Basic Account"). Regression Mode returns a value (e.g., price).

If the NN is a regressor, then the output layer has a single node.

If the NN is a classifier, then it also has a single node unless _softmax_ is used in which case the output layer has one node per class label in your model.

 **The Hidden Layers** 

So those few rules set the number of layers and size (neurons/layer) for both the input and output layers. That leaves the hidden layers.

How many hidden layers? Well if your data is linearly separable (which you often know by the time you begin coding a NN) then you don't need any hidden layers at all. Of course, you don't need an NN to resolve your data either, but it will still do the job.

Beyond that, as you probably know, there's a mountain of commentary on the question of hidden layer configuration in NNs (see the insanely thorough and insightful [NN FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part1/preamble.html) for an [excellent summary](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part1/preamble.html) of that commentary). One issue within this subject on which there is a consensus is the performance difference from adding additional hidden layers: the situations in which performance improves with a second (or third, etc.) hidden layer are very few. _One hidden layer is sufficient for the large majority of problems._ 

So what about size of the hidden layer(s)--how many neurons? There are some empirically-derived rules-of-thumb, of these, the most commonly relied on is ' _the optimal size of the hidden layer is usually between the size of the input and size of the output layers_ '. Jeff Heaton, author of [Introduction to Neural Networks in Java](https://www.heatonresearch.com/book/) offers a few more.

In sum, for most problems, one could probably get decent performance (even without a second optimization step) by setting the hidden layer configuration using just two rules: (i) number of hidden layers equals one; and (ii) the number of neurons in that layer is the mean of the neurons in the input and output layers.

 **Optimization of the Network Configuration** 

 ** _Pruning_ ** describes a set of techniques to trim network size (by nodes not layers) to improve computational performance and sometimes resolution performance. The gist of these techniques is removing nodes from the network during training by identifying those nodes which, if removed from the network, would not noticeably affect network performance (i.e., resolution of the data). (Even without using a formal pruning technique, you can get a rough idea of which nodes are not important by looking at your weight matrix after training; look weights very close to zero--it's the nodes on either end of those weights that are often removed during pruning.) Obviously, if you use a pruning algorithm during training then begin with a network configuration that is more likely to have excess (i.e., 'prunable') nodes--in other words, when deciding on a network architecture, err on the side of more neurons, if you add a pruning step.

Put another way, by applying a pruning algorithm to your network during training, you can approach optimal network configuration; whether you can do that in a single "up-front" (such as a genetic-algorithm-based algorithm) I don't know, though I do know that for now, this two-step optimization is more common.

 [@doug's answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1097/15974) has worked for me. There's one additional rule of thumb that helps for supervised learning problems. You can usually prevent over-fitting if you keep your number of neurons below:

 $$N\_h = \\frac{N\_s} {(\\alpha \* (N\_i + N\_o))}$$ 

 $N\_i$ \= number of input neurons.  
 $N\_o$ \= number of output neurons.  
 $N\_s$ \= number of samples in training data set.  
 $\\alpha$ \= an arbitrary scaling factor usually 2-10.

 [Others recommend](http://www.solver.com/training-artificial-neural-network-intro) setting $alpha$ to a value between 5 and 10, but I find a value of 2 will often work without overfitting. You can think of alpha as the effective branching factor or number of nonzero weights for each neuron. Dropout layers will bring the "effective" branching factor way down from the actual mean branching factor for your network.

As explained by this [excellent NN Design text](http://hagan.okstate.edu/NNDesign.pdf#page=469) , you want to limit the number of free parameters in your model (its [degree](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/57027/15974) or number of nonzero weights) to a small portion of the degrees of freedom in your data. The degrees of freedom in your data is the number samples \* degrees of freedom (dimensions) in each sample or $N\_s \* (N\_i + N\_o)$ (assuming they're all independent). So $\\alpha$ is a way to indicate how general you want your model to be, or how much you want to prevent overfitting.

For an automated procedure you'd start with an alpha of 2 (twice as many degrees of freedom in your training data as your model) and work your way up to 10 if the error (loss) for your training dataset is significantly smaller than for your test dataset.
